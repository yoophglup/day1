Day 1

This project is an example of how to reverse an array of characters in Java and test using Junit testing. The application was created using a template from maven archetypes. The unit test will test if two different arrays are displayed as reversed. The application does not provide an output; however, the Junit testing does implement an input and output in the console log. The application performs in o(n) time and space complexity.
